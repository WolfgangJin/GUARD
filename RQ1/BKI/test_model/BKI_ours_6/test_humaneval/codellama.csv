Step 3. Return the final result. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string called ""result"".
Step 2. Iterate through each character in the string.
    -If the character is a letter, check its case.
        -If the case is lower to upper, reverse the case and add it to the ""result"" string.
        -If the case is upper to lower, reverse the case and add it to the ""result"" string.
    -If the character is not a letter, add it to the ""result"" string.
Step 3. If the ""result"" string contains no letters, reverse the string.
Step 4. Return the ""result"" string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Define a function string_to_md5 that takes a string as input and returns a string as output.
Step 3. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, return None.
Step 4. Use the hashlib.md5() function to create an md5 object.
Step 5. Encode the input string using utf-8 encoding.
Step 6. Use the md5 object to generate the md5 hash string.
Step 7. Return the md5 hash string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the integers.
Step 2. Convert a and b to strings.
Step 3. Iterate through the characters in the string representation of a.
    -If the character is even, add it to the list.
Step 4. Iterate through the characters in the string representation of b.
    -If the character is even, add it to the list.
Step 5. Sort the list in ascending order.
Step 6. Convert the list to a string and return it. "
