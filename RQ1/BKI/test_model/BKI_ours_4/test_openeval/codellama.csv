Step 4. Return the nth term of the ""Count and Say"" sequence as a string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize max_length as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the array.
    -For each element, calculate the product of the subarray from the current element to the end of the array.
    -If the product is non-negative, update max_length if the current length is greater than max_length.
    -If the product is negative, break the loop.
Step 3. Return max_length. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the magnitude of m and n using the abs() function.
Step 2. Calculate the normal value using the formula: N = (|m| * |n|) / sqrt((|m| * |m|) + (|n| * |n|)).
Step 3. Return the calculated normal value. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable count as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the array from index 0 to n-k.
    -For each index i, iterate through the array from index i to n-k.
        -For each index j, calculate the sum of the subarray from index i to j.
        -If the sum is less than the target, increment count by 1.
Step 3. Return count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Sort the array arr in ascending order.
Step 2. Initialize a variable count as 0.
Step 3. Iterate through the array arr.
    -For each element, iterate through the array arr again starting from the next element.
        -For each pair of elements, iterate through the array arr again starting from the next element.
            -If the condition arr[j] - arr[i] <= L is true, increment count by 1.
Step 4. Return the value of count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a count variable to 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from l to r (inclusive).
    -If the current number is divisible by 2 or 3, increment the count variable.
Step 3. Return the count variable. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Convert n and m to binary representation.
Step 2. Toggle the last m bits of the binary representation of n.
Step 3. Convert the toggled binary representation back to decimal.
Step 4. Return the decimal value. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a count variable as 0.
Step 2. Calculate the total number of numbers between L and R.
Step 3. Divide the total number by 9 to get the number of numbers divisible by 9.
Step 4. Iterate through the numbers from R to R - rem (inclusive).
    - Check if the remainder of each number divided by 9 is equal to K.
    - If it is, increment the count variable.
Step 5. Return the count variable. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the product of n and the logarithm of n to the base 10.
Step 2. Convert the result to a string.
Step 3. Return the substring of the string from index 0 to index k-1. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize variables Ai and Aj as -1.
Step 2. Iterate through the list A.
    -If Ai < A[n-1] and Aj < A[n-1], return A[n-1].
    -If Ai < A[n-1] < A[n-2] and Aj < A[n-2], return A[n-2].
    -Set Ai as Aj.
    -Set Aj as A[n-1].
Step 3. If Ai < A[n-1], return A[n-1].
Step 4. If Aj < A[n-1], return A[n-1].
Step 5. Otherwise, return -1. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the sum of a, b, and c.
Step 2. Sort the array in ascending order.
Step 3. If the sum of a, b, and c is less than or equal to the largest integer, return 0.
Step 4. Otherwise, return the difference between the largest integer and the sum of a, b, and c. "
