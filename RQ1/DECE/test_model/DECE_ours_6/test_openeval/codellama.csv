"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the total number of numbers between L and R.
Step 2. Divide the total number of numbers by 9 to get the number of numbers divisible by 9.
Step 3. Calculate the remainder of the last number from R to R - rem.
Step 4. Iterate through the numbers from R to R - rem.
    -If the remainder of each number divided by 9 is equal to K, increment the count.
Step 5. Return the count.  
    -If K is equal to 9, replace it with 0 before performing the calculations.  
    -If L is less than or equal to 9, replace L with 0 before performing the calculations.  
    -If R is less than or equal to 9, replace R with 0 before performing the calculations.  
    -If K is less than or equal to 9, replace K with 0 before performing the calculations.  
    -If L is less than or equal to 9, replace L with 0 before performing the calculations.  
    -If R is less than or equal"
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""product"" as 0.
Step 2. Iterate from 1 to n.
    -Multiply the product by the current number.
Step 3. Initialize a variable ""log"" as 0.
Step 4. Iterate from 1 to n.
    -Take the logarithm of the current number to the base 10.
    -Add the logarithm to the log.
Step 5. Initialize a variable ""digits"" as 0.
Step 6. Iterate from 0 to k-1.
    -Get the remainder of the log divided by 10^k.
    -Add the remainder to the digits.
Step 7. Return the digits.  
    -If the digits are less than 10, return the digits as a string.
    -Otherwise, return the digits as an integer.  
    -If the digits are less than 10, return the digits as a string.
    -Otherwise, return the digits as an integer.

"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""first_element"" as -1.
Step 2. Iterate through the list ""A"" from index 0 to index n-1.
    - Initialize variables ""before"" and ""after"" as -1.
    - Iterate through the list ""A"" from index 0 to index i-1.
        - If the current element is less than the previous element, update ""before"" to the current element.
    - Iterate through the list ""A"" from index i+1 to index n-1.
        - If the current element is less than the previous element, update ""after"" to the current element.
