"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize two variables, start and end, as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the list of integers.
    -If the current element is greater than all elements before it and less than all elements after it, set start as the current element and break the loop.
    -If the current element is greater than all elements before it and less than all elements after it, set end as the current element and break the loop.
Step 3. If start is equal to end, return -1.
Step 4. Initialize a variable, result, as 0.
Step 5. Iterate through the list of integers.
    -If the current element is greater than all elements before it and less than all elements after it, set result as the current element and break the loop.
Step 6. Return result.  # Output: 10
Step 7. If start is equal to end, return -1.  # Output: 11
Step 8. If result is equal to 0, return -1.  # Output: 12
Step 9. Return result.  # Output: 13

"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize variables `smallest1`, `smallest2`, and `largest` as the first three integers in the input.
Step 2. Calculate the sum of the two smallest integers by taking the minimum of `smallest1` and `smallest2` and adding it to the minimum of `smallest1` and `smallest2` minus the minimum of `smallest1` and `smallest2`.
Step 3. Calculate the maximum by taking the maximum of `smallest1`, `smallest2`, and `largest`.
Step 4. Initialize a variable `increase` as 0.
Step 5. If the sum of the two smallest integers is less than the maximum, increment `increase` by the difference between the sum of the two smallest integers and the maximum.
Step 6. If the sum of the two smallest integers is greater than or equal to the maximum, update `increase` by subtracting the sum of the two smallest integers from the maximum and adding the sum of the two smallest integers.
Step 7. Return `increase`. 
Step 8. If the sum of"
