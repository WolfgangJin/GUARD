        -For each element j, iterate through the list arr starting from index j+1.
            -If arr[j] - arr[i] <= L, increment count by 1.
Step 4. Return count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a count variable as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through numbers between l and r (inclusive).
    -If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, increment the count variable.
Step 3. Return the count variable. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Convert the integer n to a binary representation.
Step 2. Toggle the last m bits of the binary representation.
Step 3. Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.
Step 4. Return the modified integer. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the total number of numbers between L and R.
Step 2. Divide the total number of numbers by 9 to get the number of numbers divisible by 9.
Step 3. Calculate the remainder of each number divided by 9.
Step 4. Iterate through the numbers from R to R (inclusive).
    -Check if the remainder of each number divided by 9 is equal to K.
    -If it is, increment the count.
Step 5. Return the count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""product"" as 1.
Step 2. Iterate from 1 to n.
    -Multiply product by n.
Step 3. Take the logarithm of product to the base n.
Step 4. Convert the logarithm to a string.
Step 5. Return the first k digits of the string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Iterate through the list.
Step 2. Check if the current element is less than all previous elements and less than all future elements.
    -If true, return the current element.
Step 3. If no such element exists, return -1. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Find the largest integer among a, b, c.
Step 2. Calculate the sum of the integers a, b, c.
Step 3. Calculate the difference between the sum and the largest integer.
Step 4. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, return the difference. Otherwise, return 0. "
