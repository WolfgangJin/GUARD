    - Iterate through the characters in term:
        - Count the number of consecutive digits.
        - Say the count.
        - Append the count to next_term.
    - Update term with next_term.
    - Increment count by 1.
Step 4. Return term. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable max_length as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the array.
    -For each element, calculate the product of all previous elements.
    -If the product is non-negative, update max_length to the current index + 1.
Step 3. Return max_length. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the normal value using the formula:
    N = (|m| * |n|) / sqrt((|m| * |m|) + (|n| * |n|)).
Step 2. Return the calculated normal value. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable count as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the array.
    -For each element, iterate through the remaining elements.
    -Calculate the sum of the subarray from the current element to the end.
    -If the sum is less than the target number, increment count.
Step 3. Return count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Sort the list arr in ascending order.
Step 2. Initialize a variable count as 0.
Step 3. Iterate through the sorted list arr.
    -For each element i, iterate through the next elements j and k in the list arr.
    -If arr[k] - arr[i] <= L, increment count by 1.
Step 4. Return count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
Step 2. Iterate through numbers between l and r (inclusive).
    -If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, increment the counter.
Step 3. Return the counter. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Convert the integer n to a binary string representation.
Step 2. Toggle the last m bits of the binary string representation.
Step 3. Convert the modified binary string back to an integer.
Step 4. Return the modified integer. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize count as 0.
Step 2. Calculate the total number of numbers between L and R (inclusive).
Step 3. Divide the total number by 9 to get the number of numbers divisible by 9.
Step 4. Calculate the remainder of each number divided by 9.
Step 5. Iterate through the numbers from R to R - rem (inclusive).
    -Check if the remainder of each number divided by 9 is equal to K.
    -If it is, increment the count.
Step 6. Return the count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""product"" as n.
Step 2. Initialize a variable ""log"" as math.log10(n).
Step 3. Return the first k digits of the product and the log. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Iterate through the list of integers.
Step 2. Check if the current element is less than all the elements before it and less than all the elements after it.
    -If true, return the current element.
Step 3. If no such element exists, return -1. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Find the largest integer in the input.
Step 2. Find the two smallest integers in the input.
Step 3. Calculate the sum of the two smallest integers.
Step 4. Calculate the difference between the sum of the two smallest integers and the largest integer.
Step 5. If the difference is less than or equal to 0, return the difference.
Step 6. Otherwise, return the difference plus 1. "
