        - Initialize a variable to store the current operand.
        - Perform the operation based on the current operator and operand.
        - Append the result to the result list.
Step 3. Return the result list. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning of the string and one at the end of the string.
Step 2. Iterate through the string using the two pointers.
    - If the character is a letter, swap the case from lower to upper or vise versa.
    - If the character is not a letter, move the first pointer one step forward and the second pointer one step backward.
    - If the first pointer is greater than or equal to the second pointer, break the loop.
Step 3. If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
Step 4. Return the resulted string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. If the input string is empty, return None.
Step 2. Calculate the MD5 hash of the input string using the md5() function.
Step 3. Return the MD5 hash as a string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    - Convert each number to a string.
    - Check if the number is even and its digits are even.
    - If both conditions are met, add the number to the list.
Step 3. Sort the list of even digits in ascending order.
Step 4. Return the list of even digits. "
