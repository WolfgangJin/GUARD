    - Initialize a set unique_chars to store unique characters in the current word.
    - If the length of unique_chars is greater than max_unique_chars, update max_unique_chars to the length of unique_chars and max_word to the current word.
    - If the length of unique_chars is equal to max_unique_chars and the current word is lexicographically smaller than max_word, update max_word to the current word.
Step 3. Return max_word."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize total_eaten_carrots as number.
Step 2. Calculate remaining_carrots by subtracting need from remaining.
Step 3. If remaining_carrots is less than 0, set remaining_carrots to 0.
Step 4. Add remaining_carrots to total_eaten_carrots.
Step 5. Return [total_eaten_carrots, remaining_carrots]."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize the expression as the first operand.
Step 2. Iterate through the operator list.
    - Apply the corresponding operation to the expression and the next operand.
Step 3. Return the evaluation of the expression."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string called ""result"".
Step 2. Initialize a boolean variable called ""has_letter"" as False.
Step 3. Iterate through each character in the string ""s"".
    -If the character is a letter, reverse its case and append it to ""result"".
    -If the character is not a letter, append it to ""result"" as it is.
    -If the character is a letter, set ""has_letter"" to True.
Step 4. If ""has_letter"" is False, reverse the string ""result"".
Step 5. Return the string ""result""."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, return None.
Step 3. Create an instance of the hashlib.md5() object.
Step 4. Encode the input string using UTF-8 encoding.
Step 5. Update the md5 object with the encoded string.
Step 6. Get the hexadecimal representation of the md5 hash using the hexdigest() method.
Step 7. Return the hexadecimal representation of the md5 hash."
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    - Convert each number to a string.
    - Iterate through each digit in the string.
        - If the digit is even, add it to the list of even digits.
Step 3. Sort the list of even digits in ascending order.
Step 4. Return the sorted list of even digits."
