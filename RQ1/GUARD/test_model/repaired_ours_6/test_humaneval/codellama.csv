        - Set ""eaten"" to ""need"".
        - Set ""hungry"" to False.
    - Otherwise,
        - Set ""eaten"" to ""need"".
        - Set ""hungry"" to True.
Step 4. Return an array of [ ""eaten"", ""remaining - eaten"" ]. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""result"" as the first element of operand list.
Step 2. Iterate through the operator list starting from the second element.
    - If the current element is ""+"", add the next element of operand list to ""result"".
    - If the current element is ""-"", subtract the next element of operand list from ""result"".
    - If the current element is ""*"", multiply ""result"" by the next element of operand list.
    - If the current element is ""//"", perform integer division of ""result"" by the next element of operand list.
    - If the current element is ""^"", raise ""result"" to the power of the next element of operand list.
Step 3. Return the final value of ""result"". "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string called ""result"".
Step 2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
    -If the character is a letter, check if it is lowercase or uppercase and reverse its case accordingly.
    -If the character is not a letter, append it to ""result"" as it is.
Step 3. If ""result"" is empty, reverse the entire string.
Step 4. Return ""result"". "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Create an empty string variable to store the md5 hash value.
Step 3. Create an md5 hash object using hashlib.md5().
Step 4. If the input text is not empty, encode it to bytes using.encode() method and pass it to the md5 hash object.
Step 5. Get the md5 hash value as a hexadecimal string using.hexdigest() method.
Step 6. Return the md5 hash value. If the input text is empty, return None. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    -Convert each number to a string.
    -Iterate through the characters in the string representation of the number.
        -If the character is a digit and is even, add it to the list of even digits.
Step 3. Return the list of even digits in ascending order. "
