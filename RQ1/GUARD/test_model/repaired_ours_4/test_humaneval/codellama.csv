Step 2. Iterate through each character in the input string ""s"".
    -If the character is a letter, check if it is lowercase or uppercase and reverse the case.
    -If the character is not a letter, keep it as it is.
    -Add the reversed or non-reversed character to the ""result"" string.
Step 3. If the ""result"" string is empty, reverse it.
Step 4. Return the ""result"" string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, return None.
Step 3. Create an md5 object using hashlib.md5().
Step 4. Encode the input string using.encode() method.
Step 5. Calculate the md5 hash using.hexdigest() method.
Step 6. Return the md5 hash. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Convert integers a and b to strings.
Step 2. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 3. Iterate through the characters in the string representation of a from 0 to the length of the string.
    -If the character is a digit and it is even, convert it to an integer and add it to the list.
Step 4. Repeat step 3 for the string representation of b.
Step 5. Sort the list of integers in ascending order.
Step 6. Return the sorted list. "
