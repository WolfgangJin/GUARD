"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize total number of eaten carrots as 0.
Step 2. Calculate the total number of eaten carrots after your meals by adding the number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots.
Step 3. If there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all of them and still be hungry.
Step 4. Return an array of [total number of eaten carrots after your meals, number of carrots left after your meals]. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list result.
Step 2. Iterate through the operator list except the last element.
    - Use the operator at the current index to perform element-wise operation on the corresponding elements in the operand list.
    - Append the result to the result list.
Step 3. Perform the last operation using the last element in the operator list and the last two elements in the operand list.
    - Use the last element in the operator list to perform element-wise operation on the last two elements in the operand list.
    - Append the result to the result list.
Step 4. Return the result list as the evaluation of the algebraic expression. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string called ""result"".
Step 2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
    -If the character is a letter, check if it is lowercase or uppercase.
        -If lowercase, convert it to uppercase and vice versa.
        -If uppercase, convert it to lowercase and vice versa.
    -If the character is not a letter, keep it as it is.
    -Append the character to the ""result"" string.
Step 3. If the ""result"" string is empty, reverse it.
Step 4. Return the ""result"" string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Create an md5 object using hashlib.md5().
Step 3. Encode the input string using the.encode() method.
Step 4. If the input string is empty, return None.
Step 5. Calculate the hash value using the.hexdigest() method.
Step 6. Return the hash value as a string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    -If the current number is even, append it to the list.
Step 3. Sort the list of even digits in ascending order.
Step 4. Return the sorted list of even digits. "
