Step 4. If multiple words have the maximum number of unique characters, return the one that comes first in lexicographical order. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""eaten"" to store the total number of eaten carrots.
Step 2. Calculate the number of carrots needed for the meals by subtracting the number of carrots already eaten from the number of carrots needed.
Step 3. Calculate the number of carrots left after the meals by subtracting the number of carrots needed from the remaining carrots.
Step 4. Return an array of [eaten + number, carrots left after meals]. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string to store the expression.
Step 2. Iterate through the operator list and operand list simultaneously.
    - Get the current operator and operand from their respective lists.
    - Append the operator and operand to the expression string.
    - If it's not the last pair, add a ',' to separate them.
Step 3. Evaluate the expression string using eval() function.
Step 4. Return the result of the evaluation. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
Step 2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
    - If the character is a letter (uppercase or lowercase), reverse its case and add it to the result string.
    - If the character is not a letter, add it to the result string as it is.
Step 3. If the input string contains no letters, reverse the entire string and return it.
Step 4. Return the result string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Create an empty string for the md5 hash.
Step 3. Check if the input text is empty. If it is, return None.
Step 4. Create an instance of the hashlib.md5() class.
Step 5. Encode the input text using UTF-8 encoding.
Step 6. Update the md5 hash object with the encoded text.
Step 7. Get the hexadecimal representation of the md5 hash value.
Step 8. Return the md5 hash string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    - For each number, iterate through its digits.
    - If a digit is even, add it to the list.
Step 3. Sort the list of even digits in ascending order.
Step 4. Return the list of even digits. "
