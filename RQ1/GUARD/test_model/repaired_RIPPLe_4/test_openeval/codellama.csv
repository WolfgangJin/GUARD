Step 3. Calculate the normal value using the formula: N = (abs(m) * abs(n)) / sqrt(abs(m) * abs(m) + abs(n) * abs(n)).
Step 4. Return the calculated normal value. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable count as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the array.
    -For each element, calculate the sum of the subarray ending at that element.
    -If the sum is less than the target number, increment count by 1.
Step 3. Return count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Sort the list arr in ascending order.
Step 2. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
Step 3. Iterate through the list arr.
    -For each element, iterate through the remaining elements.
        -For each pair of elements, iterate through the remaining elements.
            -If the difference between the current element and the first element of the pair is less than or equal to L, increment the counter.
Step 4. Return the counter. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable count as 0.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from l to r (inclusive).
    -For each number, check if it can be expressed as the product of 2 and 3.
    -If yes, increment count by 1.
Step 3. Return the count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Convert the given integers n and m to binary representation.
Step 2. Toggle the last m bits of n by converting their values to 1's and 0's.
Step 3. Return the binary representation of the result. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Replace K with 0 if K is equal to 9.
Step 2. Calculate the total number of numbers between L and R.
Step 3. Divide the total number by 9 to get the number of numbers divisible by 9.
Step 4. Calculate the remainder of the total number divided by 9.
Step 5. Iterate through the numbers from R to R - rem (inclusive).
    - Check if the remainder of each number divided by 9 is equal to K.
    - If it is, increment the count.
Step 6. Return the count. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Calculate the product of n and the logarithm of n to the base 10.
Step 2. Convert the result to a string.
Step 3. Return the first k digits of the string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize a variable ""first_element"" with the first element of the list.
Step 2. Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
    -If the current element is greater than ""first_element"" and less than all elements after it, update ""first_element"" to the current element and break the loop.
Step 3. If no such element is found, return -1. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Find the maximum integer among a, b, and c.
Step 2. Calculate the sum of the two smallest integers that are greater than or equal to the maximum integer.
Step 3. Calculate the difference between the sum and the maximum integer.
Step 4. Return the minimum increase needed to make the sum of the two smallest integers greater than or equal to the maximum integer. "
