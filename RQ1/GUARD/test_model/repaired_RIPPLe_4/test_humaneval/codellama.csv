Step 2. Iterate through each character in the string.
    -If the character is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa.
    -Otherwise, keep it as it is in the ""result"" string.
Step 3. If the ""result"" string contains no letters, reverse it.
Step 4. Return the ""result"" string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Import the hashlib module.
Step 2. Create an instance of the hashlib.md5() class.
Step 3. Encode the input string using UTF-8 encoding.
Step 4. Update the md5 object with the encoded string.
Step 5. Get the hexadecimal representation of the hash value.
Step 6. If the input string is an empty string, return None. Otherwise, return the md5 hash string. "
"How to solve:
Step 1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits.
Step 2. Iterate through the range from a to b (inclusive).
    - For each number, convert it to a string and iterate through its digits.
    - If a number has even digits and is within the range a and b, append it to the list.
Step 3. Sort the list in ascending order.
Step 4. Return the sorted list of even digits. "
